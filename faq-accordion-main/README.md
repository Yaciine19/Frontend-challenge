## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - framework css
- [Framer Motion](https://motion.dev/) - for animation

### What I learned

This challenge was really amazing! Although it took me some time, I learned new things from it. I explored the **Framer Motion** library and how it works, in addition to discovering a new fact about navigation using the **Tab** key. I didn't expect it to be this easyâ€”basically, you just add the **`tabIndex`** attribute to the element you want to navigate to.  

However, the downside was that moving forward and backward between questions was only possible using the **Tab** key, which I found time-consuming. So, I came up with another solution: I added an alternative navigation method using the **Up** and **Down** arrow keys to make the process smoother.  

It was really fun! You can check out the code and see for yourself. ðŸš€

### Continued development

In this challenge, I used React, Tailwind, and the Framer Motion library to enhance my skills, showcase them, and take them to a higher level. ðŸ‘Œ
