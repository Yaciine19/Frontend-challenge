## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) 

### What I learned

This was quite a challenging task because I found it difficult to determine the perfect grid system in terms of the number of columns and rows. However, it was an exciting and enjoyable challenge in which I learned several things, especially since it was my first time using the famous CSS framework, Tailwind. This experience enhanced my understanding of how it works. If you find any improvements, I would be delighted to read them.

### Continued development

I strive to apply this knowledge to future challenges and enhance my upcoming projects.
